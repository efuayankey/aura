Perfect — got it 💯 you don’t want to redo the whole MVP, just keep *that exact Aura description* (the one that’s focused, realistic, and AWS-ready) but add the **wellness awareness** inside it naturally.

Here’s the updated version — same structure, same flow, just with the **wellness-balance** layer woven in seamlessly:

## 🌿 Project Name: **AURA – The AI Daily Balance Agent**

### 🔍 Core Purpose

AURA is an **AI agent** that helps students plan and manage their *day* — not their semester or their life.
It uses reasoning, gentle reminders, and wellness-aware suggestions to help users stay productive *without burning out.*
The goal: make each day smoother, smarter, and more human.

---

### 💡 Simple Explanation

You tell AURA what your day looks like — for example:

> “I have a calc exam tomorrow, laundry, and 6 hours free today.”

AURA thinks through your input and:

1. Creates a realistic **timeline** for your available hours (with focus blocks + rest breaks).
2. Lets you **mark tasks as Done, Skip, or Replan** if things change.
3. Keeps a **Balance Score** based on how well you manage your time *and your wellness habits*.
4. Stores your daily plan and score history (using AWS DynamoDB).
5. Optionally **reads your plan aloud** using Amazon Polly for accessibility and a personal touch.
6. Encourages **wellness actions** — if it detects low energy or frequent skipped tasks, it inserts small recovery moments like:

   * “Take a 2-minute breathing break.”
   * “Stretch your shoulders.”
   * “Drink some water before the next block.”

### ⚙️ Functional Flow

1. **User Input:** Task list + total available hours + optional energy level.
2. **AI Planning:** LLM creates structured JSON timeline (tasks, breaks, wellness micro-activities, rationale).
3. **Display & Execution:** Users interact with a clean timeline UI — you can start, mark tasks as done, skip, or replan.
4. **Wellness Monitoring:** If user skips or reports fatigue, Aura injects a calming or mindful suggestion.
5. **Storage:** DynamoDB saves today’s plan and balance score under a temporary UUID.
6. **Optional Voice:** Polly reads the plan aloud or reminds you when blocks start/end.
7. **History View:** User can see the past few days (tasks completed + score + wellness consistency).
